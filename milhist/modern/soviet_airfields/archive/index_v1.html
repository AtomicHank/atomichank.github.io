      Over the years I've been interested in the details of Soviet air power, especially during the Cold War years. The historical records, declassified documents, and think-tank research is overwhelmingly blanketed with politics and doctrine. Surprisingly little information exists about the actual facilities and locations. Though exceptions exist, I'm convinced that many policymakers and researchers have not done their homework and are not drawing from any body of information on this subject. My intent with this website is to step forward and map out and chronicle the "where" and "what" of that secret side of the Cold War. It also makes sense of the countless mistranslated names that exist, like the "Sikharovka" that V. Belenko defected from in his MiG-25 in 1976.

           Blue airfields are military or undetermined, purple are civilian.  Minor airfields (runway less than 1000 m or a non-engineered layout) have a hollow circle with no runway pattern. Abandoned airfields have a hollow circle with a large "X".

      <b>Sources and coverage</b>.  This site is meant primarily to capture the state of the Soviet military towards the end of the Cold War (the 1980s).  Sources include maps and charts, Google Earth (LANDSAT) images, journals, and various sources on the Internet. The Department of Defense Tactical Pilotage Charts and Joint Operations Graphics, which have only been available to the public for a short number of years, have been of great help in this study.

      <b>Overview</b>.  With some exceptions, the vast majority of Soviet air bases are located near towns, which are used to provide housing and food infrastructure. Military runways are constructed to a number of cardinal lengths: 2000 meters during the early Cold War years, 2500 meters for most fighter and transport regiments, and 3000 meters for long-range bomber regiments. Exceptions exist in hot or high climates. In most cases, revetments and pads seen on satellite clearly identifiy a military facility. Conversely, one perpendicular taxiway leading to a square parking pad is a utilitarian configuration that identifies civilian airports.

      <br>
         <b>Poor information</b>.
      It is important when doing research on these bases that misinformation does exist, originating from the flight sim community (especially in air-to-air combat games). I have found a fair amount of fictional descriptions of air base operations, which suits the gameplay but does not reflect any actual order of battle that Russia or the USSR used. Most such sources are weeded out.
