The Russian-Soviet airfield database was a project I began in September 2005.
Partly it was to better understand Soviet military posture during the Cold War years.
Many books about that era neglect Air Force order of battle details and focus on personalities and command structures.
In addition to discovering more about the Cold War, I soon realised that this project was also
useful to pilots and to WWII historians.
<br><br>

For a brief time in 2006 I posted the information on a site called russianairfields.com
but due to other time constraints I abandoned it.  I then developed a script to upload much
of the content to Wikipedia for others to work on, but only completed this for airfields
from about 58N poleward.  So if the Russian airfield content on Wikipedia looks like
it came from me, it probably did.
<br><br>

Effective September 2009 I decided to update my database and re-release it on my own
website.  I am also slowly, slowly developing a Chinese
and North Korean airfield database which may be released later.
<br><br>

Complete data on former Soviet Bloc airfields continues to be a difficult problem partly due to the
limited availability of public information, a lingering remnant of the Cold War, and the
language barriers.  On the other hand due to growth of Russian language documentation there
is a lot to be learned and I am slowly learning the language.
