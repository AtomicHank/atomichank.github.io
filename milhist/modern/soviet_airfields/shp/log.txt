It appears to have been constructed in the late 1950s to guard the north approaches to Novaya Zemlya against reconnaissance flights, or as a front-line interceptor base for incoming American bombers.  Four Tu-128 long-range interceptors belonging to 72 GV AP (from Amderma) were based here in 1979.' of field NOTES has been truncated to 254 characters.
