      <p>Soviet airbases played a crucial role in the Cold War military strategy of the Soviet Union. These airbases were spread across the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries, serving both offensive and defensive functions. Here’s an overview of their primary uses during this period:

		<li><b>Strategic and Tactical Air Defense-</b> Soviet airbases were central to defending the USSR from potential NATO airstrikes, especially from strategic bombers and nuclear weapons. The airbases housed interceptor aircraft like the MiG-25 and MiG-31, designed to detect and intercept enemy planes.</li><br>

		<li><b>Power Projection and Influence-</b> The Soviet Union used airbases in Eastern Europe, particularly in Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary), to project power into Western Europe. These airbases supported rapid response and allowed the USSR to position tactical bombers and fighter aircraft near NATO borders.</li><br>

		<li><b>Nuclear Deterrence-</b> Several airbases were part of the Soviet nuclear triad, housing bombers like the Tu-95 and Tu-22M, which were capable of delivering nuclear weapons. These strategic bombers were vital in the USSR's deterrence strategy against the U.S. and NATO.</li><br>

		<li><b>Forward Operating Bases in Afghanistan-</b> During the Soviet-Afghan War (1979–1989), Soviet airbases in Central Asia and Afghanistan were key to supporting Soviet military operations. They provided logistical and air support for ground troops, deployed transport aircraft, and stationed attack helicopters like the Mi-24 for counterinsurgency operations.</li><br>

		<li><b>Training and Maintenance-</b> Soviet airbases also functioned as major centers for training pilots and maintaining aircraft. The USSR had numerous specialized airfields dedicated to pilot training, testing new aircraft, and servicing their vast fleet.</li><br>

		<li><b>Strategic Mobility-</b> Airbases supported the deployment of Soviet forces globally, providing refueling, logistics, and staging grounds for long-range military operations. Air transport played a critical role in mobilizing Soviet forces during rapid deployments.</li><br>

		In summary, Soviet airbases in the 1980s were essential elements of both defense and offensive strategies, serving as hubs for nuclear deterrence, air defense, tactical power projection, and military operations in conflict zones like Afghanistan.</p>
