The airfield was under threat of being taken by the Soviet Red Army but Hermann Göring forbade its evacuation, despite request from Major General Fiebig, who was in charge of the air supply for Stalingrad [WIKI]. On 23 December Göring give permission to evacuate, but it was too late; Tatsinskaya was overrun a day later, with the German Luftwaffe losing almost 70 of the 180 Ju 52s stationed there and all ground equipment [WIKI]. The fall of the airfield, along with the one at Morozovskaya being threatened, brought supplies to the 6th Army to a halt until the 26th [WIKI].  Also briefly retaken by the Germans on the 28th, Tatsinskaya fell back into Soviet hands by 31 December [WIKI].  After the fall of Tatsinskaya, the Ju 52 from there were relocated to Salsk, while the He 111 went to Novocherkassk, increasing the distance to travel considerably.Part of the runway is 80 m wide, suggesting that alert aircraft were parked along the main runway itself.",
